# Evidence Archive

This directory contains archived evidence and supporting materials for DevEx examples in the main list.

## Simple Structure

Store all evidence files directly in this folder using descriptive filenames:
- `company-name-evidence-type.ext` (e.g., `stripe-growth-metrics.pdf`, `github-developer-survey.png`)

## File Guidelines

### All Evidence Types
- Use descriptive filenames: `company-feature-evidence-type.ext`
- Keep files under 5MB each (use compression for larger files)
- Include source URL and date in a companion `.md` file if needed

### Supported Formats
- **Documents:** `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt` for case studies and reports
- **Images:** `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif` for screenshots and infographics  
- **Data:** `.csv`, `.json` for metrics and survey data

## Examples
```

```

## Maintenance

- Review quarterly for relevance
- Remove outdated evidence that no longer supports claims
- Add new evidence as it becomes available
- Use web archive links when original sources break

## Contributing Evidence

When adding evidence:
1. Use descriptive filenames with company name
2. Reference the evidence file in the main README.md entry
3. Include source attribution in filename or companion file
4. Verify all files are under 5MB

This simplified structure makes evidence easier to find and maintain while supporting the credibility of our curated list.
